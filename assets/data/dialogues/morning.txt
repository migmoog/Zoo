I woke up rather sharply, I haven't been sleeping well recently.
Everytime I fall asleep I have a dream where I'm in a dark room covered in butter. I don't even LIKE butter.
But that's fine, I'm going to see my ._Best Friend_. today and enjoy the zoo. So hopefully nothing goes awry there.
And I'm hoping that they don't have...
Hogs! *shudders* at the zoo...
