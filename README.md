# flixel-template
This is a slightly modified version of the HaxeFlixel game template.

The only difference between this and the original template is that: 
- Bracket formatting style is changed, 
- there are directories in `source` for objects and states
- Testing uses `lime build` and the Live Server extension for VScode
